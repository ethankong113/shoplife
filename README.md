## Future Directions for the Project

In addition to the features above, there are a few more bonus features to increase the overall experience of ShopLife.

### Advanced Search

Users are only allowed to search products by their names right now. It's better to allow users search for other users, trips, or shops as well. And keyword/tag search would be another powerful bonus feature.

### Map

Users should be able to discover the stores and products by location. They should be able to map a trip on Google Map.
